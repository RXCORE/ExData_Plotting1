###  Submitted by Ron Rick Chua

R Codes are located under the Forked Version 

[https://github.com/RXCORE/ExData_Plotting1/MYPROJECT](https://github.com/RXCORE/ExData_Plotting1/MYPROJECT).

And the Plot images are located under
[https://github.com/RXCORE/ExData_Plotting1/MYPROJECT/PLOTS](https://github.com/RXCORE/ExData_Plotting1/MYPROJECT/PLOTS).


## Plots that have been generated using R programming

### Plot 1: Histogram of Global Active Power
